- 👋 Hi, I’m @KPThusago, a highly detail-oriented, results-driven accounting Graduate with strong accounting and financial skills at the entry-level.
- 👀 I’m interested in the CIMA professional qualification while simultaneously getting experience in digital costing and digital strategy in the form of a CIMA traineeship as I am an aspiring Chartered Global Management Accountant.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to set up kinds of budgeting, using various costing systems and financing options to assist operational and financial managers in the workforce with decision-making planning for the ultimate growth of the organisation and maximising shareholders' wealth.
